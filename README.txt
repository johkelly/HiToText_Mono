SUMMARY:

Command-line or interactive utility for extraction and insertion of high
scores in the .hi and .nvram data files generated by MAME.

===============================================================================
COMPATIBILITY:

You MAME exectuable must be compiled with support for these high score
files; an early version of MAME removed this functionality due to issues
with emulation accuracy, replacing it with something very similar to
save-state functionality. To replace this functionality, follow the
instructions at:

http://forum.arcadecontrols.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=7929773b5b601aa494a44b83d44661bd&topic=64298.0

Also note that not all arcade ROMs are compatible with this functionality
in MAME, and fewer still with HiToText. This is due to each ROM requiring
its own explicitly defined read/write functionality for the bytes stored
in memory by the game. If you find a game you want to have high score
support for but which does not currently have support, the above link
has instructions. Contact the current project maintainer to have your
work folded into the project.

===============================================================================
USAGE:

Opening HiToText without command-line arguments will begin an interactive mode.
In this mode, you can enter commands to perform various actions, as below:

[-r|-ra|-w|-wa|-m|-f|-fa|-e|-l|-lp|-u|-v|-h|-q] [FILENAME|REFERRER] [SCORE DATA SEPARATED BY SPACES] (-v [DATE IN MMDDYYYY FORMAT])

-r  : Read             e.g. -r  trackfld.nv
-ra : Read All         e.g. -ra trackfld.nv
-ra : Read All         e.g. -ra trackfld.nv -v 06222009
-w  : Write            e.g. -w  trackfld.nv 1 100000 FOO
-wa : Write Alternate  e.g. -wa trackfld.nv "LONG JUMP WORLD RECORD" 1 9.12m FOO
-m  : Modify           e.g. -m  trackfld.nv 1 FOO
-f  : Format           e.g. -f  trackfld.nv
-fa : Format Alternate e.g. -fa trackfld.nv
-e  : Erase All Scores e.g. -e  trackfld.nv
-l  : List Games       e.g. -l
-lp : List Parents     e.g. -lp [FULL PATH TO MAME]
-u  : Update           e.g. -u  [REFERRER]
-v  : Version          e.g. -v  [FULL PATH TO MAME FOLDER]
-h  : Help             e.g. -h
-q  : Quit             e.g. -q

NOTES: To write a hiscore entry, view the format first to get the score or alternate data format.
       Ensure that you use quotation marks around fields that contain spaces.
       If the update command sees a newer version it will return a URL to download a newer version.
       If it's determined that there is no new version, it will return "No newer version available."
       REFERRER should be something simple so some statistics can be tracked.

       The version command will show you what version of MAME HiToText thinks you are using.
       This is done by date. HiToText will use today's date if it cannot find the version 
       information automatically.

       You can specify your own version (by date) of HiToText if it is not 
       determining your version correctly. You can only do this with the -r, -ra, -w, and -wa flags.
       You can see your mame version by running mame with the -help command. (e.g. mame -help).

       Different versions of MAME will read .hi or nvram files differently so be sure HiToText is
       using the correct version for your files.

       The modify command only takes a score rank and a name field, and instead of inserting a score
       will use the data provided to modify the name of the score given by the rank provided.

To use HiToText as a command-line utility, simply append the command you
wish to execute to the end of the execution call.
